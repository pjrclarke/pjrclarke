#  ü´•  About Me #

Full-time code wrangler, part-time purveyor of humor. Since my coding journey began in March of this year, I have traversed remarkable strides in the realm of software development. Armed with my keyboard and fueled by copious amounts of caffeine, I am devoted to conquering bugs and overcoming the treacherous terrain of merge conflicts. With fluency in the mystical languages of binary and Python, I craft both code and puns with precision. While I undertake serious endeavors, I firmly believe that laughter is an essential ingredient for success in programming. Beyond the screen, I indulge in gaming exploits, transforming into a stealthy coding ninja. Together, let us embark on an exhilarating adventure, navigating the realms of technology and humor. Through innovation and wit, I strive to make the world a better place, one line of code and an occasional meme at a time. Join me as we break new ground and create wonders, for in just a few months, I have already made significant progress in this enchanting world of coding. Remember, when faced with uncertainty, trust in the power of Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. Let's code, laugh, and achieve greatness together!

# üî≠  Current Projects #

Currently, I am actively pursuing the completion of a highly esteemed course, which has significantly enhanced my proficiency in the field of software development. In parallel, I am participating in the [Hays x SCFG Hackathon](https://app.hayscodeco.com/events/hackathon/ea799866-2ed7-4b77-862c-075779e0eb2c), collaborating with exceptional talents to conceive and implement innovative solutions.

Additionally, I am proactively engaging with local businesses, presenting them with the opportunity to leverage my freelance web development expertise. By delivering meticulously crafted websites, I aim to empower these enterprises with a robust online presence, thereby facilitating their growth and expanding their reach within the local and global markets. As I embark on this exhilarating journey, I eagerly anticipate the exciting prospects and possibilities that lie ahead.

# ‚ö°  Fun fact #

I had the incredible opportunity to serve as the scrum master for my first hackathon organised by Code Institute. Our project centered around the vibrant theme of PRIDEüåà, aiming to create an engaging and user-friendly map that showcases the diverse history of pride events across the globe. The outcome was an outstanding website that offers an immersive experience, allowing users to explore the map, hover over countries to reveal their outlines, and delve into the captivating history of pride in each country with just a click. It fills me with joy to share that our team emerged as the first-place winners.
